This Rust program finds and prints the generators of the group Z_n × Z_m, where Z_n and Z_m are additive groups.
It identifies all pairs (a,b) that generate the entire group.
This program contains the following;
1. ZnZm Struct that represents the group Z_n × Z_m.
2. find_generators Method that finds all generator pairs (a,b) of the group.
3. is_generator Method to check if a given pair (a,b) is a generator.
4. main Function to emonstrate the usage of the ZnZm struct to find and print generators for a specific group.
